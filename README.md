# Rain Alert Application
This project is a Python-based script that fetches weather data from an online API and checks if it will rain the next day. If rain is expected, the script automatically sends an email notification with the message: "It will rain tomorrow."

Features
Retrieves weather forecast data from a public API.

Analyzes the forecast to detect rain on the following day.

Sends an automatic email alert if rain is predicted.

Deployed on a server and runs independently on a schedule (e.g., daily at 20:00, via cron), requiring no manual intervention.

Use Case
Perfect for users who want to be proactively informed about upcoming rain without checking the weather manually.
